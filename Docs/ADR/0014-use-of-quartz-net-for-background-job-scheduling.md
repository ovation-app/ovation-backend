# ADR 0014: Use of Quartz.NET for Background Job Scheduling

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Deciders:** Development Team  
**Consulted:** Architecture Review Board  

## Context  
The Ovation platform requires extensive background processing for data synchronization, user analytics, and maintenance tasks. With 15+ background jobs including blockchain data synchronization, user metrics collection, and data cleanup, we need a reliable, scalable job scheduling solution.

## Decision  
Use Quartz.NET for background job scheduling and execution. This includes:
- Scheduled job execution for data synchronization
- Cron-based scheduling for recurring tasks
- Job persistence and recovery
- Clustering support for scalability
- Integration with ASP.NET Core dependency injection

## Alternatives Considered  
- **Hangfire**: Considered but Quartz.NET provides better enterprise features
- **Background Services**: Rejected due to limited scheduling capabilities
- **Azure Functions**: Considered but requires cloud dependency
- **Custom Scheduler**: Rejected due to complexity and maintenance overhead

## Consequences  
**Positive:**
- Robust job scheduling and execution
- Cron-based scheduling flexibility
- Job persistence and recovery capabilities
- Clustering support for scalability
- Excellent .NET ecosystem integration
- Comprehensive monitoring and management

**Negative:**
- Additional complexity and learning curve
- Memory usage for job storage
- Potential performance overhead
- Configuration complexity
- Dependency on external library

## Implementation Notes  
- Job classes in Infrastructure layer
- ServiceExtensions configuration for Quartz.NET
- Database persistence for job state
- Error handling and retry policies
- Monitoring and logging integration
- Performance optimization and tuning
