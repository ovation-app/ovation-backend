# ADR 0016: Use of Sentry for Error Tracking

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Deciders:** Development Team  
**Consulted:** Architecture Review Board  

## Context  
The Ovation platform requires comprehensive error tracking and monitoring for production stability. With complex multi-blockchain integrations, real-time features, and external API dependencies, we need proactive error detection, detailed error context, and performance monitoring.

## Decision  
Use Sentry for comprehensive error tracking and performance monitoring. This includes:
- Automatic error capture and reporting
- Performance monitoring and transaction tracking
- User context and session tracking
- Release tracking and deployment monitoring
- Integration with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing

## Alternatives Considered  
- **Application Insights**: Considered but Sentry provides better error tracking features
- **Custom Error Logging**: Rejected due to complexity and maintenance overhead
- **Log-based Monitoring**: Rejected due to limited real-time capabilities
- **Multiple Tools**: Considered but Sentry provides comprehensive solution

## Consequences  
**Positive:**
- Comprehensive error tracking and alerting
- Rich context information for debugging
- Performance monitoring and optimization insights
- User session tracking and replay
- Release tracking and deployment correlation
- Excellent .NET ecosystem integration

**Negative:**
- Additional dependency and cost
- Data privacy considerations
- Performance overhead for error reporting
- Learning curve for team
- Potential information leakage

## Implementation Notes  
- Sentry configuration in Infrastructure layer
- Custom error enrichment and context
- Integration with OpenTelemetry
- User context tracking and privacy controls
- Performance monitoring configuration
- Error filtering and sampling strategies
