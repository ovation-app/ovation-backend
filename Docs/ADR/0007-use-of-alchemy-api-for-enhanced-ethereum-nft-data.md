# ADR 0007: Use of Alchemy API for Enhanced Ethereum NFT Data

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-05-05  

## Context  
Abstract NFTs are a key focus. We need detailed metadata, transaction history, and Web3-enhanced APIs.

## Decision  
Integrate the [Alchemy NFT API](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/nft-api-quickstart) to supplement and validate Abstract NFT data.

## Consequences  
- Provides high-reliability and fast indexing.
- Redundant with NFTScan in some areas but deeper in others.
- Additional cost if premium features are used.
