# ADR 0015: Use of OpenTelemetry for Observability

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Deciders:** Development Team  
**Consulted:** Architecture Review Board  

## Context  
The Ovation platform requires comprehensive observability for monitoring, debugging, and performance optimization. With complex multi-blockchain integrations, real-time features, and background processing, we need distributed tracing, metrics collection, and logging correlation across all system components.

## Decision  
Use OpenTelemetry for comprehensive observability including:
- Distributed tracing across all layers
- Metrics collection and aggregation
- Log correlation and structured logging
- Integration with external monitoring systems
- Performance monitoring and analysis

## Alternatives Considered  
- **Application Insights**: Considered but OpenTelemetry provides vendor neutrality
- **Custom Logging**: Rejected due to complexity and maintenance overhead
- **Third-party APM**: Considered but OpenTelemetry provides better flexibility
- **Basic Logging Only**: Rejected due to insufficient observability

## Consequences  
**Positive:**
- Vendor-neutral observability standard
- Comprehensive distributed tracing
- Rich metrics collection capabilities
- Excellent .NET ecosystem integration
- Flexible export to multiple backends
- Industry standard with broad support

**Negative:**
- Additional complexity and configuration
- Performance overhead for tracing
- Learning curve for developers
- Potential data volume concerns
- Configuration complexity

## Implementation Notes  
- OpenTelemetry configuration in Infrastructure layer
- Custom tracing instrumentation for business logic
- Integration with Sentry for error tracking
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Metrics collection for key business indicators
