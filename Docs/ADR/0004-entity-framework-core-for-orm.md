# ADR 0004: Entity Framework Core for ORM

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Deciders:** Development Team  
**Consulted:** Architecture Review Board  

## Context  
We need a reliable and maintainable way to interact with our MySQL database. The Ovation platform requires complex queries across 49 entities, support for migrations, and efficient data access patterns for multi-blockchain NFT data.

## Decision  
Use Entity Framework Core in the Infrastructure layer to implement repository interfaces defined in the Application layer. This includes:
- Code-first approach with migrations
- Repository pattern implementation
- Unit of Work pattern for transaction management
- LINQ for query composition
- Change tracking for entity updates

## Alternatives Considered  
- **Dapper**: Rejected due to lack of change tracking and migration support
- **ADO.NET**: Rejected due to high maintenance overhead
- **NHibernate**: Rejected due to .NET Core compatibility and complexity
- **Raw SQL**: Rejected due to maintenance and security concerns

## Consequences  
**Positive:**
- High productivity via LINQ and change tracking
- Built-in migration support for schema evolution
- Strong typing and IntelliSense support
- Excellent .NET ecosystem integration
- Built-in connection pooling and performance optimizations
- Comprehensive query optimization features

**Negative:**
- Coupling to EF Core and potential performance considerations
- Complex queries may require optimization
- Learning curve for advanced scenarios
- Potential N+1 query problems if not careful
- Memory usage for change tracking

## Implementation Notes  
- DbContext implementation in Infrastructure layer
- Repository pattern with generic base repository
- Unit of Work pattern for transaction management
- Migration strategy for database schema changes
- Query optimization and performance monitoring
- Connection string configuration via environment variables
