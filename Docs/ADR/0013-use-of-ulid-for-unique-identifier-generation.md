# ADR 0013: Use of ULID for Unique Identifier Generation

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Deciders:** Development Team  
**Consulted:** Architecture Review Board  

## Context  
The Ovation platform requires unique identifiers for entities across multiple systems and databases. Traditional GUIDs have performance and sorting issues, while sequential integers have security and scalability concerns. We need a solution that provides uniqueness, performance, and sortability.

## Decision  
Use ULID (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier) for generating unique identifiers across the platform. ULID provides:
- Lexicographically sortable identifiers
- Time-based ordering with millisecond precision
- Cryptographically secure randomness
- URL-safe base32 encoding
- 128-bit identifier space

## Alternatives Considered  
- **GUID/UUID**: Rejected due to poor database performance and lack of sortability
- **Sequential Integers**: Rejected due to security concerns and scalability issues
- **Snowflake IDs**: Considered but ULID provides better .NET ecosystem support
- **Custom ID Generation**: Rejected due to complexity and maintenance overhead

## Consequences  
**Positive:**
- Lexicographically sortable for better database performance
- Time-based ordering enables chronological sorting
- Cryptographically secure randomness
- URL-safe encoding for web applications
- Better performance than GUIDs in databases
- No sequential number exposure

**Negative:**
- Additional dependency
- Learning curve for developers
- Potential confusion with traditional GUIDs
- Limited ecosystem support compared to GUIDs
- Case sensitivity considerations

## Implementation Notes  
- ULID generation in Domain layer for entity creation
- Database indexing strategy for ULID columns
- Migration from existing ID systems
- Integration with Entity Framework Core
- Performance testing and optimization
- Documentation for development team
