# ADR 0017: Use of JWT for Authentication

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Deciders:** Development Team  
**Consulted:** Architecture Review Board  

## Context  
The Ovation platform requires secure, stateless authentication for API access and real-time communication. With multiple authentication providers (Google, X/Twitter, Normal), WebSocket connections, and distributed architecture considerations, we need a token-based authentication solution.

## Decision  
Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication across the platform. This includes:
- JWT token generation and validation
- Multi-provider authentication (Google, X/Twitter, Normal)
- Token-based authorization for API endpoints
- JWT authentication for SignalR WebSocket connections
- Secure token storage and refresh mechanisms

## Alternatives Considered  
- **Session-based Authentication**: Rejected due to scalability and state management issues
- **OAuth 2.0 with Custom Tokens**: Considered but JWT provides better standardization
- **API Keys**: Rejected due to security and user experience concerns
- **Custom Token System**: Rejected due to complexity and security concerns

## Consequences  
**Positive:**
- Stateless authentication for scalability
- Standardized token format
- Self-contained token information
- Excellent ecosystem support
- Easy integration with multiple providers
- Stateless nature enables horizontal scaling

**Negative:**
- Token size limitations
- Security considerations for token storage
- No built-in token revocation
- Potential performance overhead for validation
- Learning curve for security best practices

## Implementation Notes  
- JWT configuration in Infrastructure layer
- Custom authentication filters (TokenFilter, CoreFilter)
- Multi-provider authentication handlers
- Token refresh and expiration handling
- Security best practices implementation
- Integration with SignalR authentication
